## General info
A simple game of poker where the program shuffles and cuts a deck of cards, and then deals 5 cards into two arrays (you and the computer.) Each hand is then evaluated and then a winner is awarded based on the strongest combination of cards. This code is programmed to evaluate all ties until they can no longer be resolved.

This version does not include draws/discards or any betting. It is just a straight showdown, poker at its simplest.
